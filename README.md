![Hurricane Logo](https://example.com/hurricane_logo.png)

## Description
Welcome to Hurricane 🌀! This repository contains an asynchronous PHP framework designed to handle non-blocking I/O operations efficiently. With Hurricane, you can build high-performance web applications that leverage asynchronous programming to handle multiple tasks concurrently.

## Features
🌪️ Asynchronous Programming: Utilize async-await syntax to handle multiple I/O operations simultaneously without blocking the execution flow.

🌪️ Non-blocking I/O: Hurricane allows for non-blocking I/O operations, enabling your applications to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

🌪️ WebSocket Support: Easily integrate WebSocket functionality into your applications using Hurricane's WebSocket features.

🌪️ Promises: Leverage promises to handle asynchronous operations and manage their results gracefully.

## Usage
Here's a simple example to demonstrate creating an HTTP server using Hurricane:

```php
use Hurricane\Http\HttpServer;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$server = new HttpServer('127.0.0.1', 8000);

$server->on('request', function (ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response) {
    $response->getBody()->write('Hello, Hurricane!');
    return $response;
});

$server->start();
```

In this example, we create an HTTP server that listens on localhost port 8000 and responds with a simple message. You can customize the server behavior by adding more request handlers.
